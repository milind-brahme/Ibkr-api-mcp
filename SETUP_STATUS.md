# IBKR MCP Server - Setup Status

## 🔄 CURRENT STATUS: READY FOR VS CODE TESTING

### ✅ PROJECT COMPLETION STATUS
- **MCP Server**: ✅ Built and functional (starts successfully)
- **VS Code Config**: ✅ Properly configured in settings.json  
- **Test Suite**: ✅ 22/22 tests passing
- **Gateway**: ⚠️ Installed but configuration issues remain

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP
**Test VS Code MCP Integration** (can test without Gateway):
1. **Restart VS Code completely** to load MCP server configuration
2. Open VS Code chat interface (Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Test server recognition: `@ibkr-trading Can you check if the IBKR connection is working?`
4. Verify tools are available: `@ibkr-trading What tools do you have available?`

### ⚠️ GATEWAY ISSUE
IBKR Gateway configuration problems:
- Configuration file loading errors persist  
- May need official IBKR installer instead of manual setup
- Can proceed with VS Code testing - server handles connection failures gracefully

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS FOR REAL-WORLD TESTING

### 1. IBKR Client Portal Gateway Setup
**Required**: Download and install IBKR Client Portal Gateway

#### Download Instructions:
1. Go to https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ib-api.php
2. Download "Client Portal Web API" (stable version)
3. Extract to `C:\Users\milin\clientportalapi`
4. Set environment variable:
   ```powershell
   $env:IBKR_GATEWAY_DIR = "C:\Users\milin\clientportalapi"
   ```

#### Gateway Configuration:
Create `conf.yaml` in gateway root folder:
```yaml
listenPort: 5000
listenSsl: true
paperTrading: true  # Recommended for testing
```

### 2. Start IBKR Gateway
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\milin\Ibkr-api-mcp"
.\scripts\start-gateway.bat
```

### 3. Authentication Setup
1. Navigate to `https://localhost:5000` in browser
2. Accept SSL certificate warning
3. Login with IBKR credentials
4. Complete 2FA if required

### 4. Test VS Code Integration
1. Restart VS Code to load new MCP configuration
2. Open VS Code Chat
3. Test IBKR commands:
   - "@ibkr-trading get authentication status"
   - "@ibkr-trading get account summary"
   - "@ibkr-trading search contracts for AAPL"

## 📁 FILES READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

### Core Server Files:
- ✅ `dist/index.js` - Main MCP server
- ✅ `dist/services/ibkr-client.js` - IBKR API client
- ✅ `dist/tools/` - All tool implementations

### Configuration:
- ✅ `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- ✅ `.env` - Environment variables (create if missing)
- ✅ VS Code `settings.json` - MCP server configuration

### Scripts:
- ✅ `scripts/start-gateway.bat` - Gateway startup
- ✅ `scripts/build-and-start.bat` - Build and run server

## 🧪 TESTING COMMANDS

### Test MCP Server Standalone:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\milin\Ibkr-api-mcp"
node dist/index.js
```

### Test with Debug Output:
```powershell
$env:DEBUG = "*"
node dist/index.js
```

### Run Unit Tests:
```powershell
npm test
```

## 🚨 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Gateway Required**: Real trading requires IBKR Gateway running
2. **Authentication**: Must login via web interface first
3. **Paper Trading**: Recommended for initial testing
4. **SSL Certificates**: May need to accept self-signed certificates

## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- ✅ Project builds without errors
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ MCP server starts successfully
- ✅ VS Code configuration is valid
- ⏳ IBKR Gateway installation (pending)
- ⏳ Gateway authentication (pending)
- ⏳ VS Code chat integration test (pending)
- ⏳ Real API calls verification (pending)

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

The setup will be complete when:
1. IBKR Gateway is running on https://localhost:5000
2. Authentication is successful via web interface
3. VS Code chat can communicate with IBKR MCP server
4. Basic commands work (authentication status, account summary)
5. Market data and trading tools respond correctly
